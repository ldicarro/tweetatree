# Tweet-a-Tree #

A Python script run locally on a Raspberry Pi using a relay board and speaker to play songs and flash lights. The Python script uses a PHP script on the web to search Twitter using the Twitter API and searches for any tweets to @tweetatree. The user will tweet a song title from the list of songs on the Raspberry Pi, if the script recognizes it, the song will play and the lights will flash using LightShow Pi (http://lightshowpi.org/).

This project originally used an early version of LightShow Pi. This project is progressing toward using more recent versions.
